    <p>Entrepreneurship is the act of starting and running a business. Many people dream of being entrepreneurs because they want to be their own bosses and make something new. It can be a shop, a tech company, or even a small home-based business. Being an entrepreneur is exciting but also challenging. You have to make plans, manage money, and know how to sell your product or service. Good entrepreneurs are creative and brave. They are willing to try new things and take risks. But risks can also mean failure. Thatâ€™s why itâ€™s important to learn from mistakes and keep going. You also need to know how to manage money well because running a business costs money. Entrepreneurs help communities. They create jobs and can make new things that improve peopleâ€™s lives. They also pay taxes, which helps the government do its job. In short, entrepreneurship is good for everyone. It gives people a chance to make their dreams come true and helps the world be a better place.</p>

<p>Fiverr is a platform that connects freelancers with business owners looking for services in various digital projects, including website design, content writing, and voice-overs. Additionally, itâ€™s one of the top freelancing websites for students.

    This freelance website provides a streamlined method for both freelancers and business owners to interact with one another. Note that on the website, freelancers are called sellers, their services â€“ gigs, and business owners â€“ buyers. 
    
    Instead of sending out bids, sellers can sign up for free, list their gigs, and set their prices. Meanwhile, buyers can simply browse through different categories to purchase. 
    
    Whenever a buyer purchases a gig, the system automatically charges their account and puts the money on hold. The system will then take a commission fee and send freelancers 80% of the offered price.</p>
